The occasion was a solemn one, for it was before a council held in Rome presided over jointly by Pope Leo IV. and the Emperor Louis II. Peter relied upon written charters, while Cantius produced witnesses. The Emperor pronounced the claim of the latter to be just, when he and twelve priests swore that the oaths of the witnesses were true and without deceit, whereupon the disputed parishes were adjudged to him.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"slide slide--layout-1\" id=\"slide--6\">\r\n        <div class=\"slide__figure slide__figure--main\" data-sort=\"1\">\r\n            <img class=\"slide__figure-img slide__figure-img--landscape\" src=\"/3c6f833871671df3dd286608c1e75b1b.jpg\">\r\n        </div>\r\n        <h2 class=\"slide__title\">Zenosyne</h2>\r\n        \r\n        <div class=\"slide__text\">\r\n            <p class=\"slide__text-meta\">by Benjamin Brighton on 2/21</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n        \r\n        <button class=\"slide__back\">\r\n            <a href=\"#test-slides-6\">&larr;</a>\r\n        </button>\r\n        <div class=\"slide__content\">\r\n            <p>What would one give for a few human touches in connexion with our old silver! We may imagine that our candlesticks of the year 1750 held the flickering wax candles which were guttering when the dawn broke when our great-great-grandfather lost his fortune at cards in the county of —, or maybe it was somebody else’s grandfather. But this is in the realms of fancy, and the fortune is literally fabulous. Why are there no George Morlands in the silversmith’s craft? Cannot the guilds dig out their romantic history from their archives? Just to think that our designer of candelabra and flagons ran a fine career on Hounslow Heath with gamesters and fighting men; or did he, just that once, have a duel with young Lord What’s-his-Name in the Guards, and pinked him? Did not the story get to White’s and to the Cocoa Tree Clubs, how the tradesman scored! But no such thing. All these initials of makers are empty of such vanities. We can do better with prints. Those who possess the engraved work of Ryland have the satisfaction of knowing that he was hounded by Bow Street runners and hid, like the modern Lefroy, at Stepney, and that he was hanged for forgery.</p>\r\n            <p>The scene may readily be imagined. The second of May 1696 had been fixed by Parliament as the last day in which the crowns, half-crowns, and shillings were to be received in payment of taxes for face value. The guards had to be called in to keep order. The Exchequer was besieged by a vast multitude from dawn to midnight. The Act provided that the money was to be brought in by before the 4th of May. The 3rd was a Sunday, therefore Saturday, the 2nd of May, was actually the last day.</p>\r\n            <p>A remarkable use of conjurators to confirm the evidence of witnesses occurs in 850 in a dispute between Cantius, Bishop of Siena, and Peter, Bishop of Arezzo, concerning certain parishes claimed by both. The occasion was a solemn one, for it was before a council held in Rome presided over jointly by Pope Leo IV. and the Emperor Louis II. Peter relied upon written charters, while Cantius produced witnesses. The Emperor pronounced the claim of the latter to be just, when he and twelve priests swore that the oaths of the witnesses were true and without deceit, whereupon the disputed parishes were adjudged to him.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"slideshow-swipe\">\r\n        <!--<i class=\"far fa-hand-point-up\"></i>-->\r\n        <p class=\"swipe-text\"><span id=\"left-swipe\">&larr;</span> Swipe <span id=\"right-swipe\">&rarr;</span></p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <script src=\"/42f69825340f0b5fa628d80900a46daa.js\"></script>\r\n</div>\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n</html> "},"sourceMaps":null,"error":null,"hash":"6ad1173eb5ca06686b8ed4fc1661c0eb","cacheData":{"env":{}}}
